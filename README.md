**Project building**

 - Modular homebrew. Made with c and sdl, using VitaSDK.
 
 - use cmake and make to build the vpk


**Prerequisites**

 - To run the program you will need a psvita with henkaku on it, or an emulator (like  
    Vita3K). 


**Installing and running**

 - Send the generated .vpk to your ps vita either via ftp or via usb with vitashell, 
   then install it. This will create a new bubble, named BMAX, have fun.
